# dice-game

Getting back into learning Front End Development. After about 6 months of a hiatus, it is time to dust of the old memory, and make sure the basics of HTML, CSS and JS are still intact. This is a simple Dice Game with 2 players,  push a button and see who gets the higher dice roll. DOM manipulation is used to update the visuals on the dice.
